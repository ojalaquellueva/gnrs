Flags as cultivated observations within a given radius of a city.
Currently, radius is based on the relationship between area and
population of a city, converting the area to a circle and taking the
radius of the circle.

Sets: 
isCultivated=1
isCultivatedReason=CONCAT(isCultivatedReason," Proximity to city ")

Rather unsatisfactory was of flagging cultivated specimens, 
apparently high rate of false positives. Especially for many
population-dense Andean cities, excludes important collections
from nearby mountains
